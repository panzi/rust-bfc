A Brainfuck Compiler Written In Rust
====================================

Just for fun.

This compiles to Linux x86 64 assembler and emits a small C runtime for dynamic
memory management. It uses guard pages around `mmap()` allocated memory. Once a
guard is stripped (`SIGSEGV` handler) the memory is resized appropriately. It
even can handle memory underruns and resizes the memory to the bottom. It emits
assembler because after moving the memory the register holding the pointer to
the current cell needs to be adjusted and therefore I need to control what
register that is. This makes it all very architecture and operating system
dependant.

Alternatively it can also just run brainfuck programs in interpreter mode.

It supports several optimizations. If the brainfuck program doesn't depend on
input it can be executed during compilation and the resulting program will
just be a single `fwrite()` and will not contain the memory management runtime.

It calls `gcc` and `nasm` to compile the generated code.

I haven't done any x86 (64 or 32 bit) before, so that part was fun. I hope I
did it all right.
